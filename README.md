# Capstone Project - Python Fundamentals

This repository contains a capstone project that applies core Python programming skills including data analysis, data cleaning, and visualization using the `pandas` and `numpy`libraries. The goal is to derive insights from a sample sales dataset and demonstrate proficiency in data handling and interpretation.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

The project involves:
- Reading and preprocessing a sales dataset.
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Grouping and filtering data for insight generation.
- Visualizing trends and patterns using bar plots and pie charts.

## ðŸ§° Skills and Tools Used

### Programming:
- Python 3.x

### Libraries:
- `pandas` â€“ Data manipulation and analysis
- `numpy` â€“ Numerical computations
- `matplotlib.pyplot` â€“ Data visualization

### Concepts Applied:
- Data loading and cleaning
- Data grouping and aggregation
- Value counts and frequency analysis
- Data visualization (bar charts, pie charts)
- String operations and filtering in dataframes

## ðŸ“Š Key Features

- Monthly sales trend analysis
- Top-selling products and cities
- Relationship between product sales and price
- Insights into customer purchase behavior

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/capstone-python-fundamentals.git
